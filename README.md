# Friend Finder 

## Description

*Friend Finder* is an application that match's a user with a new friendm, based on the responses they submit in a ten question survey. Each questions asks for a rating from 1 - Strongly Disagree - to 5 - Strongly Agree. These answers are then compared to the responses of existing user records, and the one that is closet to theirs is return.

This Friend Finder application has some *Marvel-ous* records

## Demo

Due to the implementation of Node.js, and Express, the website is deployed on Heorku. Try the website [here.](https://obscure-fjord-17821.herokuapp.com/)


## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to better understand how to use and implement Express alongside Node.js, as well as partitioning different parts of the script into individual JS files in order to better organize and maintain the code for the application as a whole. This project also provided the opportunity to understand how servers (conceptually) function and how to use Heroku.
